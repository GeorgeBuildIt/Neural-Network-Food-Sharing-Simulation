# Neural-Network-Food-Sharing-Simulation
A simulation of agents interactions where agents compete for food using the "Prisoner's Dilemma" ruleset where agents may share or steal food from the other which provokes the evolution of the agents neural networks over time with strategies becoming more dominant based on the environmental parameters.
